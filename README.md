Part 1 Documentation
====================
All pulled html files have the style block commented out. 

In Grimm's Fairy Tales by Jacon Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm, I added an image of the Grimm brothers including an image caption. I have cited the source from wikipedia, and I have included the url as a code comment within the html file.

Liberties taken with Part 2 of the assignment:

* Did not strive to make my personal webpage look as close to the oatmeal comic as possible, however I believe the essence of the bad design is there. I have the babbling sheep and pet images everywhere!
* Used some webkit animation stuff for the top section bar area.
* I didn't have a sidebar of points, instead I made it a section that spanned the width of the page.
